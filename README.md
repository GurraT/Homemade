## UX

### User story
#### We aspect this platform to be used as an alternative to marketplaces that advertises products that already are establish on the market

#### Typical user would be 
- Innovators that in an easy way wants to try if their products are ready for the market
- Buyers who are looking for something unique that not already exist on the market today
 
#### We suppose people in the two user-categories  above will be in the agespan between 18 to 65 year

#### These two categories have different needs
- Innovator are aspected to ask for an easy, intuative tool for publishing images, description, price and details connected to their products. The outcome from this tool should be published in such way that the product stands out and is easy to find and that the products unique selling point are adressed. For publishing their ideas the probably prefer to use a computer.

- Buyer need a tool to in simpler maner find products within their scope of interest. The product should also be presented in a way that it is easy to make a decision to buy our not. The search for unique products should not be limited by device used. Products should be just as easy to find on the telephone as on the computer.

#### The wide age-range could be divided into smaller categories after their expectation

- 18- 25 years are looking for something with a WOW-factor something new and trendy with cool and interactive design which could be viewed on the telephone

- 25- 45 years are looking for a clear, informative platform where it is easy to find and evualate products, which is applicable both on computer and mobile devices

- 45 - 65 years are looking for simple, easy-to-use and informative plattform, not so much pop-up and extra information, their first alternativ are probably using a computer

### Decision to make

The different user and age-spans have different needs and expectation therefore we have to find a compromise on how this platform should be set up.
#### Decision to make is 
- weither the content should be written in local language or in English.
- If it should be appealing for the older or younger age span
- If it should have simple or functional advanced apperence

#### Decision made for the first protype is

1. Adopting a simple design where products are the main focus
2. The design should be responsive
3. The responsive design should be adopted with the users need in mind
4. Main focus on mobile design should be buyers and younger age-span
5. Main focus on computer design should be innovators and older age-span
6. Clone and link it to social media such as twitter, facebook, linked-in
