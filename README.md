Today there are lots of options in buying products over the internet and there are also channels were people marketing their own ideas. Although these channels are usely limited to a narrow interest field. Our aim is to combine the growing interest of digital markets with the hunger for localy made and unique products. We aim to be a platform were you can find a large variety of homemade products. We want to make it simple for innovators to bring their ideas to the market and allow buyers to find local, unique and homemade products. 

 
## UX

### User story
#### We aspect this platform to be used as an alternative to marketplaces that advertises products that already are establish on the market

#### Typical user would be 
- Innovators that in an easy way wants to try if their products are ready for the market
- Buyers who are looking for something unique that not already exist on the market today
 
#### We suppose users in the two categories  above will be in the agespan between 18 to 65 year

#### These two categories have different needs
- Innovator are aspected to ask for an easy, 
intuative tool for publishing images, description, 
price and details connected to their products. 
The outcome from this tool should be published in 
such way that the product stands out and is easy to 
find and that the product's unique selling point are 
adressed. For publishing their ideas the probably
 prefer to use a computer.

- Buyer need a tool to in simple maner find products 
within their scope of interest. The product should
 also be presented in a way that it is easy to make
  a decision to buy our not. The search for unique 
  products should not be limited by device type used. 
  Products should be just as easy to find on the 
  telephone as on the computer.

#### The wide age-range could be divided into smaller categories after their expectation

- 18- 25 years are looking for something with a 
WOW-factor something new and trendy with a cool and 
interactive design which could be viewed on the telephone.

- 25- 45 years are looking for a clear, informative platform where it is easy to find and evualate products, which is applicable both on computer and mobile devices

- 45 - 65 years are looking for a simple, easy-to-use and informative platform, not so much pop-ups and extra informations, their first alternativ are probably to use a computer

### Decisions to make

The different user and age-spans have different needs and expectation therefore we have to find a compromise on how this platform should be set up.
#### Decisions to make are 
- Weither the contents should be written in local language or in English.
- If it should be appealing for the older or younger age span
- If it should have simple or functional advanced appearance

#### Decisions made for the first protype are

1. Adopting a simple design where products are the main focus
2. The design should be responsive
3. The responsive design should be adopted with the users need in mind
4. Main focus on mobile design should be focusing on buyers and younger age-span
5. Main focus on computer design should be focusing on innovators and older age-span
6. Clone and link it to social media such as twitter, facebook, linked-in
